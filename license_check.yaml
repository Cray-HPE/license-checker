# Recognized filename patterns and corresponding comment types.
# * Pattern syntax follows Python fnmatch. Use separate entries to address files in root folder (as 'filename') and in subfolders (as '*/filename').
# * Order is important - first pattern match wins.
# * type (mandatory) is checked first and will be applied if run with --fix
# * alternative_type (optional) will be checked next. Will pass validation, but file will be converted to main type if run with --fix.
